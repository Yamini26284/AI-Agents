# ðŸ¤– My AI Agents Learning Journey

This repository serves as a public log of my journey into the fascinating world of AI Agents. Here, I'm documenting everything I learn, from foundational concepts to hands-on projects.

## What's Inside?

* **Hugging Face AI Agents Course:** My progress, notes, and solutions for the exercises and assignments from the official [Hugging Face AI Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit0/introduction). This course forms the core of my current learning.
* **Beyond the Course:** As I explore other resources, research papers, tutorials, and build my own agent projects, they'll be added here. This is a place to consolidate all my AI agent-related learning.
